## About!🧾

**Mini-Movie APP** is a project made with pure JavaScript, HTML and CSS.
It's a nearly-infinite recomendation movie app, it consumes the MovieDB API, an API that provides tons of movie Info.
It filters the movie requests too, to guarantee that at least one of the mainly informations(photo, name or info) appears for the user.

I've learned a lot with this project, mainly how to consume an API and manipulate it with Async Functions.
